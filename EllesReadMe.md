1. check logged in api routes. I know they need to be changed, just wasn't sure what we were changing them to. That was my blocker. I wasn't able to continue splash page because it continually redirected me to login page even when I signed up and created an account. Sent a pic of logged in page that redirected to User - check out the id.
2. logged in - but couldn't see user dashboard.
3. check Task Display index.js. I was able to write the code, but not really check it without logging in. I'm sure there is a way, but I was unsure how to implement it effectively.
4. If anyone has a clue how to make the input boxes align to the right I'd appreciate a note, smoke signal or video.
5. life 54 of the signupform.js in components - I changed the redirect there so I could get some work done on the splash page. I'm not sure how it looks though because as soon as I navigated away it kicked me and I couldn't figure out how to get back. what worked the first time did not work the second time.
6. I'm pretty sure the splash page needs a store? Does the splash page need a store? or does it just go in with the index... 
7. I could not for the life of me find the link that was holding the login form redirect hostage. I probably looked at it 10 times and just derped. 
8. Sorry I wasn't much help yall.
