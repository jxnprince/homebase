## Key Features

### Teams

Authenticated users can create teams. Each team can be assigned a name, team members, and projects. This is a great feature that can help build community by allowing people to work towards a goal together. Parents can especially appreciate this feature as it allows them to easily divide tasks among their children.  New team members can be added via the blue form on the left side of the page.

## Challenge

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was when there was an accidental uploading one of the .venv files to GitHub. Unfortunately, it overwrote my own .venv file, and I was no longer allowed to enter my own shell environment. More trouble came when I realized that I could not install the dependencies on the recloned project. I was able to fix the issue by searching through an old commit. I realized that our Pipfile had also been changed as well, so that instead of having all the version numbers for the dependencies, there was just an asterisk. Once I reverted it back to the original Pipfile, I was able to install everything and get it working again.

```js
click = "*"
gunicorn = "*"
itsdangerous = "*"
python-dotenv = "*"
six = "*"
Flask = "*"
Flask-Cors = "*"
Flask-SQLAlchemy = "*"
Flask-WTF = "*"
```

```js
click = "==7.1.2"
gunicorn = "==20.0.4"
itsdangerous = "==1.1.0"
python-dotenv = "==0.14.0"
six = "==1.15.0"
Flask = "==1.1.2"
Flask-Cors = "==3.0.8"
Flask-SQLAlchemy = "==2.4.4"
Flask-WTF = "==0.14.3"
```
